# Settings
Configuration for **Django RESTQL** is all namespaced inside a single Django setting named `RESTQL`, below is a list of what you can configure under `RESTQL` setting.

## QUERY_PARAM_NAME
The default value for this is `query`. If you don't want to use the name `query` as your parameter, you can change it with`QUERY_PARAM_NAME` on settings file e.g
```py
# settings.py file
RESTQL = {
    "QUERY_PARAM_NAME": "your_favourite_name"
}
```
Now you can use the name `your_favourite_name` as your query parameter. E.g

`GET /users/?your_favourite_name={id, username}`

## MAX_ALIAS_LEN
The default value for this is 50. When creating aliases this setting limit the number of characters allowed in aliases. This setting prevents DoS like attacks to API which might be caused by clients specifying a really really long alias which might increase network usage. If you want to change the default value, do as follows

```py
# settings.py file
RESTQL = {
    "MAX_ALIAS_LEN": 100  # Put the value that you want here
}
```

## AUTO_APPLY_EAGER_LOADING
The default value for this is `True`. When using the `EagerLoadingMixin`, this setting controls if the mappings for `select_related` and `prefetch_related` are applied automatically when calling `get_queryset`. To turn it off, set the `AUTO_APPLY_EAGER_LOADING` setting or `auto_apply_eager_loading` attribute on the view to `False`.
```py
# settings.py file
# This will turn off auto apply eager loading globally
RESTQL = {
    "AUTO_APPLY_EAGER_LOADING": False
}
```

If auto apply eager loading is turned off, the method `apply_eager_loading` can still be used on your queryset if you wish to select or prefetch related fields according to your conditions, For example you can check if there was a query parameter passed in by using `has_restql_query_param`, if true then apply eager loading otherwise return a normal queryset.
```py
from rest_framework import viewsets
from django_restql.mixins import EagerLoadingMixin
from myapp.serializers import StudentSerializer
from myapp.models import Student

class StudentViewSet(EagerLoadingMixin, viewsets.ModelViewSet):
	serializer_class = StudentSerializer
	queryset = Student.objects.all()

    # Turn off auto apply eager loading per view
    # This overrides the `AUTO_APPLY_EAGER_LOADING` setting on this view
    auto_apply_eager_loading = False
    select_related = {
		"program": "course"
	}
	prefetch_related = {
		"program.books": "course__books"
	}

	def get_queryset(self):
	    queryset = super().get_queryset()
	    if self.has_restql_query_param:
	        queryset = self.apply_eager_loading(queryset)
        return queryset
```
