# Querying Data
**Django RESTQL** simplifies querying data by allowing you to dynamically select fields to be included in a response.

To enable this, simply inherit from the `DynamicFieldsMixin` class when defining your serializer, that's all.

Below is an example showing how to use `DynamicFieldsMixin`.

```py
from rest_framework import serializers
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from django_restql.mixins import DynamicFieldsMixin


class UserSerializer(DynamicFieldsMixin, serializer.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = User
        fields = ["id", "username", "email"]
```

Here a regular request returns all fields specified in the serializer, as **Django RESTQL** does not interfere with normal requests.

Below is an example of a regular request and its response 

`GET /users`

```js
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "username": "yezyilomo",
        "email": "yezileliilomo@hotmail.com",
    },
    ...
]
```

As you can see all fields have been returned as specified on the `UserSerializer`.

**Django RESTQL** handle all requests with a `query` parameter, this parameter is the one which is used to pass all fields to be included/excluded in a response.

For example to select `id` and `username` fields from User model, send a request with a ` query` parameter as shown below.

`GET /users/?query={id, username}`
```js
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "username": "yezyilomo"
    },
    ...
]
```
With this only `id` and `username` fields get returned in a response as specified on a `query` parameter.


## Querying nested fields
**Django RESTQL** support querying both flat and nested data, so you can expand or query nested fields at any level as defined on a serializer.

In an example below we have `location` and `groups` as nested fields on User model.

```py
from rest_framework import serializers
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from django_restql.mixins import DynamicFieldsMixin

from app.models import GroupSerializer, LocationSerializer


class GroupSerializer(DynamicFieldsMixin, serializer.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Group
        fields = ["id", "name"]


class LocationSerializer(DynamicFieldsMixin, serializer.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Location
        fields = ["id", "country",  "city", "street"]


class UserSerializer(DynamicFieldsMixin, serializer.ModelSerializer):
    groups = GroupSerializer(many=True, read_only=True)
    location = LocationSerializer(many=False, read_only=True) 
    class Meta:
        model = User
        fields = ["id", "username", "email", "location", "groups"]
```

If you want to retrieve user's `id`, `username` and `location` fields but under `location` field you want to get only `country` and `city` fields here is how you can do it

`GET /users/?query={id, username, location{country, city}}`
```js
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "username": "yezyilomo",
        "location": {
            "contry": "Tanzania",
            "city": "Dar es salaam"
        }
    },
    ...
]
```

<h3>More examples to get you comfortable with the query syntax</h3>
`GET /users/?query={location, groups}`
```js
[
    {
        "location": {
            "id": 1,
            "contry": "Tanzania",
            "city": "Dar es salaam",
            "street": "Oyster Bay"
        }
        "groups": [
            {"id": 2, "name": "Auth_User"},
            {"id": 3, "name": "Admin_User"}
        ]
    },
    ...
]
```



`GET /users/?query={id, username, groups{name}}`
```js
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "username": "yezyilomo",
        "groups": [
            {"name": "Auth_User"},
            {"name": "Admin_User"}
        ]
    },
    ...
]
```

!!! note
    Using commas(`,`) to separate fields and arguments is optional, you can use spaces too just like in GraphQL
    For example you could write your query as ```query={id  username  location{country  city}}``` so the choice is yours.

## Exclude(-) operator
Using **Django RESTQL** filtering as it is when there are no many fields on a serializer is great, but sometimes you might have a case where you would like everything except a handful of fields on a larger serializer. These fields might be nested and trying the whitelist approach might possibly be too long for the url. 

**Django RESTQL** comes with the exclude(-) operator which can be used to exclude some fields in scenarios where you want to get all fields except few ones. Using exclude operator is very simple, you just need to prepend the exclude(-) operator to the field which you want to exclude when writing your query, that's all. 

Take an example below

```py
from rest_framework import serializers 
from django_restql.mixins import DynamicFieldsMixin

from app.models import Location, Property


class LocationSerializer(DynamicFieldsMixin, serializer.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Location
        fields = ["id", "city", "country", "state", "street"]


class PropertySerializer(DynamicFieldsMixin, serializer.ModelSerializer):
    location = LocationSerializer(many=False, read_only=True) 
    class Meta:
        model = Property
        fields = [
            "id", "price", "location"
        ]
```

If we want to get all fields under `LocationSerializer` except `id` and `street`, by using the exclude(-) operator we could do it as follows

`GET /location/?query={-id, -street}`
```js
[
    {
        "country": "China",
        "city": "Beijing",
        "state": "Chaoyang"
    },
    ...
]
```
This is equivalent to `query={country, city, state}`

You can use exclude operator on nested fields too, for example if you want to get `price` and `location` fields but under `location` you want all fields except `id` here is how you could do it.

`GET /property/?query={price, location{-id}}`
```js
[
    {
        "price": 5000
        "location": {
            "country": "China",
            "city" "Beijing",
            "state": "Chaoyang",
            "street": "Hanang"
        }
    },
    ...
]
```
This is equivalent to `query={price, location{country, city, state, street}}`

<h3>More examples to get you comfortable with the exclude(-) operator</h3>
Assuming this is the structure of the model we are querying
```py
data = {
    username,
    birthdate,
    location {
        country,
        city
    },
    contact {
        phone,
        email
    }
}
```

Here is how we can structure our queries to exclude some fields by using exclude(-) operator
```py
{-username}   ≡   {birthdate, location{country, city}, contact{phone, email}}

{-username, contact{phone}, location{country}}   ≡    {birthdate ,contact{phone}, location{country}}

{-contact, location{country}}   ≡    {username, birthdate, location{country}}

{-contact, -location}   ≡    {username, birthdate}

{username, location{-country}}   ≡    {username, location{city}}

{username, location{-city}, contact{-email}}   ≡    {username, location{country}, contact{phone}}
```

## Wildcard(*) operator
In addition to the exclude(-) operator, **Django RESTQL** comes with a wildcard(\*) operator for including all fields. Using a wildcard(\*) operator is very simple, for example if you want to get all fields from a model by using a wildcard(\*) operator you could simply write your query as 

`query={*}`

This operator can be used to simplify some filtering which might endup being very long if done with other approaches. For example if you have a model with this format 

```py
user = {
    username,
    birthdate,
    contact {
        phone,
        email,
        twitter,
        github,
        linkedin,
        facebook
    }
}
```
Let's say you want to get all user fields but under `contact` field you want to get only `phone`, you could use the whitelisting approach and write your query as 

`query={username, birthdate, contact{phone}}` 

but if you have many fields on user model you might endup writing a very long query, such problem can be avoided by using a wildcard(\*) operator which in our case we could simply write the query as

`query={*, contact{phone}}`

The above query means "get me all fields on user model but under `contact` field get only `phone` field". As you can see the query became very short compared to the first one after using wildcard(\*) operator and it won't grow if more fields are added to a user model.

<h3>More examples to get you comfortable with the wildcard(*) operator</h3>
```py
{*, -username, contact{phone}}   ≡   {birthdate, contact{phone}}

{username, contact{*, -facebook, -linkedin}}   ≡   {username, contact{phone, email, twitter, github}}

{*, -username, contact{*, -facebook, -linkedin}}   ≡   {birthdate, contact{phone, email, twitter, github}}
```


Below is a list of mistakes which leads to query syntax/format error, these mistakes may happen accidentally as it's very easy/tempting to make them with the exclude(-) operator and wildcard(*) operator syntax.
```py
{username, -location{country}}  # Should not expand excluded field
{*username}  # What are you even trying to accomplish
{*location{country}}  # This is definitely wrong
```


## Aliases
When working with an API, you may want to rename a field to something more suitable than what the API provides. Aliases let you do exactly that—without changing the backend.

Aliases are defined on the client side, so you can freely rename fields in your query without touching the API code.

Imagine requesting data using the following query from an API:

`GET /users/?query={id, updated_at}`

You will get the following JSON response:

```js
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "updated_at": "2021-05-05T21:05:23.034Z"
    },
    ...
]
```

Here the `updated_at` field works but it doesn’t quite conform to the camel case convention in JavaScript(Which is where APIs are used mostly). Let’s rename it with an alias.

`GET /users/?query={id, updatedAt: updated_at}`

Response:

```js
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "updatedAt": "2021-05-05T21:05:23.034Z"
    },
    ...
]
```

Creating an alias is very easy just like in [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#aliases). Simply add a new name and a colon(:) before the field you want to rename.

<h3>More examples</h3>

Renaming `date_of_birth` to `dateOfBirth`, `course` to `programme` and `books` to `readings`

`GET /students/?query={name, dateOfBirth: date_of_birth, programme: course{id, name, readings: books}}`

This yields

```js
[
    {
        "name": "Yezy Ilomo",
        "dateOfBirth": "04-08-1995",
        "programme": {
            "id": 4,
            "name": "Computer Science",
            "readings": [
                {"id": 1, "title": "Alogarithms"},
                {"id": 2, "title": "Data Structures"},
            ]
        }
    },
    ...
]
```

!!! note
    The default maximum alias length is 50 characters, it's controlled by `MAX_ALIAS_LEN` setting. This is enforced to prevent DoS like attacks to API which might be caused by a client specifying a really long alias which may increase network usage. For more information about `MAX_ALIAS_LEN` setting and how to change it see [this section](/django-restql/settings/#max_alias_len).


## DynamicSerializerMethodField
`DynamicSerializerMethodField` is a wrapper around DRF’s `SerializerMethodField`.
Its main advantage is that it passes the parsed query from the parent serializer into the method, enabling you to apply further querying to nested serializers inside that method.

This is especially useful when you want to make a field returned by `SerializerMethodField` queryable. 

For example in the scenario below we are using `DynamicSerializerMethodField` because we want to be able to query `related_books` field.

```py
from django_restql.mixins import DynamicFieldsMixin
from django_restql.fields import DynamicSerializerMethodField


class CourseSerializer(DynamicFieldsMixin, serializers.ModelSerializer):
    # Use `DynamicSerializerMethodField` instead of `SerializerMethodField`
    # if you want to be able to query `related_books`
    related_books = DynamicSerializerMethodField()
    class Meta:
        model = Course
        fields = ["name", "code", "related_books"]

    def get_related_books(self, obj, parsed_query):
        # With `DynamicSerializerMethodField` you get this extra
        # `parsed_query` argument in addition to `obj`
        books = obj.books.all()

        # You can do what ever you want in here

        # `parsed_query` param is passed to BookSerializer to allow further querying
        serializer = BookSerializer(
            books,
            many=True, 
            parsed_query=parsed_query
        )
        return serializer.data
```

`GET /course/?query={name, related_books}`
```js
[
    {
        "name": "Data Structures",
        "related_books": [
            {"title": "Advanced Data Structures", "author": "S.Mobit"},
            {"title": "Basic Data Structures", "author": "S.Mobit"}
        ]
    }
]
```

`GET /course/?query={name, related_books{title}}`
```js
[
    {
        "name": "Data Structures",
        "related_books": [
            {"title": "Advanced Data Structures"},
            {"title": "Basic Data Structures"}
        ]
    }
]
```

With `DynamicSerializerMethodField`, you can make even custom, computed fields queryable — giving your API consumers fine-grained control over the response.


## DynamicFieldsMixin kwargs
`DynamicFieldsMixin` accepts extra kwargs in addition to those accepted by a serializer, these extra kwargs can be used to do more customizations on a serializer as explained below.

### fields kwarg
With **Django RESTQL** you can specify fields to be included when instantiating a serializer, this provides a way to refilter fields on nested fields(i.e you can opt to remove some fields on a nested field). Below is an example which shows how you can specify fields to be included on nested resources. 

```py
from rest_framework import serializers
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from django_restql.mixins import DynamicFieldsMixin

from app.models import Book, Course


class BookSerializer(DynamicFieldsMixin, serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Book
        fields = ["id", "title", "author"]


class CourseSerializer(DynamicFieldsMixin, serializers.ModelSerializer):
    books = BookSerializer(many=True, read_only=True, fields=["title"])
    class Meta:
        model = Course
        fields = ["name", "code", "books"]
```

`GET /courses/`
```js
[
    {
        "name": "Computer Programming",
        "code": "CS50",
        "books": [
            {"title": "Computer Programming Basics"},
            {"title": "Data structures"}
        ]
    },
    ...
]
```
As you see from the response above, the nested resource(book) has only one field(title) as specified on  `fields=["title"]` kwarg during instantiating BookSerializer, so if you send a request like 

`GET /course?query={name, code, books{title, author}}` 

you will get an error that `author` field is not found because it was not included in `fields`.


### exclude kwarg
You can also specify fields to be excluded when instantiating a serializer by using `exclude` kwarg, below is an example which shows how to use `exclude` kwarg.

```py
from rest_framework import serializers
from django_restql.mixins import DynamicFieldsMixin

from app.models import Book, Course


class BookSerializer(DynamicFieldsMixin, serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Book
        fields = ["id", "title", "author"]


class CourseSerializer(DynamicFieldsMixin, serializers.ModelSerializer):
    books = BookSerializer(many=True, read_only=True, exclude=["author"])
    class Meta:
        model = Course
        fields = ["name", "code", "books"]
```

`GET /courses/`
```js
[
    {
        "name": "Computer Programming",
        "code": "CS50",
        "books": [
            {"id": 1, "title": "Computer Programming Basics"},
            {"id": 2, "title": "Data structures"}
        ]
    },
    ...
]
```
From the response above you can see that `author` field has been excluded fom book nested resource as specified on  `exclude=["author"]` kwarg during instantiating BookSerializer.

!!! note
    `fields` and `exclude` kwargs have no effect when you access the resources directly, so when you access books you will still get all fields i.e

    `GET /books/`
    ```js
    [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "title": "Computer Programming Basics",
            "author": "S.Mobit"
        },
        ...
    ]
    ```
    You can see that all fields have appeared as specified on `fields = ["id", "title", "author"]` on BookSerializer class.


### query kwarg
**Django RESTQL** allows you to query fields by using `query` kwarg too, this is used if you don't want to get your query string from a request parameter, in fact `DynamicFieldsMixin` can work independently without using request. So by using `query` kwarg if you have serializers like 

```py
from rest_framework import serializers
from django_restql.mixins import DynamicFieldsMixin

from app.models import Book, Course


class BookSerializer(DynamicFieldsMixin, serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Book
        fields = ["id", "title", "author"]


class CourseSerializer(DynamicFieldsMixin, serializers.ModelSerializer):
    books = BookSerializer(many=True, read_only=True, exclude=["author"])
    class Meta:
        model = Course
        fields = ["name", "code", "books"]
```

You can query fields as  

```py
objs = Course.objects.all()
query = "{name, books{title}}"
serializer = CourseSerializer(objs, many=True, query=query)
print(serializer.data)

# This will print
[
    {
        "name": "Computer Programming",
        "books": [
            {"title": "Computer Programming Basics"},
            {"title": "Data structures"}
        ]
    },
    ...
]
```

As you see this doesn't need a request or view to work, you can use it anywhere as long as you pass your query string as a `query` kwarg.


### parsed_query kwarg
In addition to `query` kwarg, **Django RESTQL** allows you to query fields by using `parsed_query` kwarg. Here `parsed_query` is a query which has been parsed by a `QueryParser`. You probably won't need to use this directly as you are not adviced to write parsed query yourself, so the value of `parsed_query` kwarg should be something coming from `QueryParser`. If you have serializers like 

```py
from rest_framework import serializers
from django_restql.mixins import DynamicFieldsMixin

from app.models import Book, Course


class BookSerializer(DynamicFieldsMixin, serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Book
        fields = ["id", "title", "author"]


class CourseSerializer(DynamicFieldsMixin, serializers.ModelSerializer):
    books = BookSerializer(many=True, read_only=True, exclude=["author"])
    class Meta:
        model = Course
        fields = ["name", "code", "books"]
```

You can query fields by using `parsed_query` kwarg as follows

```py
import QueryParser from django_restql.parser

objs = Course.objects.all()
query = "{name, books{title}}"

# You have to parse your query string first
parser = QueryParser()
parsed_query = parser.parse(query)

serializer = CourseSerializer(objs, many=True, parsed_query=parsed_query)
print(serializer.data)

# This will print
[
    {
        "name": "Computer Programming",
        "books": [
            {"title": "Computer Programming Basics"},
            {"title": "Data structures"}
        ]
    },
    ...
]
```

`parsed_query` kwarg is often used with `DynamicMethodField` to pass part of the parsed query to nested fields to allow further querying.


### return_pk kwarg

With **Django RESTQL**, you can control whether nested resources return their full data or just their primary keys (PKs) by using the `return_pk` keyword argument.

Below is an example showing how to use `return_pk` kwarg:

```py
from rest_framework import serializers
from django_restql.mixins import DynamicFieldsMixin

from app.models import Book, Course


class BookSerializer(DynamicFieldsMixin, serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Book
        fields = ["id", "title", "author"]


class CourseSerializer(DynamicFieldsMixin, serializers.ModelSerializer):
    books = BookSerializer(many=True, read_only=True, return_pk=True)
    class Meta:
        model = Course
        fields = ["name", "code", "books"]
```

`GET /course/`
```js
[
    {
        "name": "Computer Programming",
        "code": "CS50",
        "books": [1, 2]
    },
    ...
]
```
So you can see that on the nested field `books` pks have been returned instead of the full book data because `return_pk=True` was set on the `BookSerializer` inside `CourseSerializer`.


### disable_dynamic_fields kwarg
Sometimes there are cases where you want to disable fields filtering on a specific nested field, **Django RESTQL** allows you to do so by using `disable_dynamic_fields` kwarg when instantiating a serializer. Below is an example which shows how to use `disable_dynamic_fields` kwarg.

```py
from rest_framework import serializers
from django_restql.mixins import DynamicFieldsMixin

from app.models import Book, Course


class BookSerializer(DynamicFieldsMixin, serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Book
        fields = ["id", "title", "author"]


class CourseSerializer(DynamicFieldsMixin, serializers.ModelSerializer):
    # Disable fields filtering on this field
    books = BookSerializer(many=True, read_only=True, disable_dynamic_fields=True)
    class Meta:
        model = Course
        fields = ["name", "code", "books"]
```

`GET /course/?query={name, books{title}}`
```js
[
    {
        "name": "Computer Programming",
        "books": [
            {"id": 1, "title": "Computer Programming Basics", "author": "J.Vough"},
            {"id": 2, "title": "Data structures", "author": "D.Denis"}
        ]
    },
    ...
]
```

In this example, even though the query requested only the `title` field for `books`, all fields were returned. This is because `disable_dynamic_fields=True` was set on the `BookSerializer` within `CourseSerializer`. Field filtering still applied to `CourseSerializer`, but not to its nested `BookSerializer`.


## Query arguments
Just like GraphQL, Django RESTQL allows you to pass arguments. These arguments can be used to do filtering, pagination, sorting and other stuffs that you would like them to do. Below is a syntax for passing arguments

```
query = (age: 18){
    name,
    age,
    location(country: Canada, city: Toronto){
        country,
        city
    }
}
```
Here we have three arguments, `age`, `country` and `city` and their corresponding values.

To escape any special character in a string(including `, : " ' {} ()`) use backslash `\`, single quote `'` or double quote `"`, also if you want to escape double quote you can use single quote and vice versa. Escaping is very useful if you are dealing with data containing special characters e.g time, dates, lists, texts etc. Below is an example which contain an argument with a date type.

```
query = (age: 18, join_date__lt: "2020-04-27T23:02:32Z"){
    name,
    age,
    location(country: "Canada", city: "Toronto"){
        country,
        city
    }
}
```


### Query arguments data types
Django RESTQL supports five primitive data types for query arguments which are `String`, `Int`, `Float`, `Boolean`, and `null`

The table below shows possible argument values and their corresponding python values

| Argument Value                      | Python Value                      |

Below is a query showing how these data types are used

```
query = (age__gt: 18, is_active: true, location__ne: null, height__gt: 5.4){
    name,
    age,
    location(country: "Canada"){
        country,
        city
    }
}
```


### Filtering & pagination with query arguments
As mentioned before you can use query arguments to do filtering and pagination, Django RESTQL itself doesn't do filtering or pagination but it can help you to convert query arguments into query parameters from there you can use any library which you want to do the actual filtering or any pagination class to do pagination as long as they work with query parameters. To convert query arguments into query parameters all you need to do is inherit `QueryArgumentsMixin` in your viewset, that's it. For example

```py
# views.py

from rest_framework import viewsets
from django_restql.mixins import QueryArgumentsMixin

class StudentViewSet(QueryArgumentsMixin, viewsets.ModelViewSet):
	serializer_class = StudentSerializer
	queryset = Student.objects.all()
	filter_fields = {
		"name": ["exact"],
		"age": ["exact"],
		"location__country": ["exact"],
        "location__city": ["exact"],
	}
```

Whether you are using [django-filter](https://github.com/carltongibson/django-filter) or [djangorestframework-filters](https://github.com/philipn/django-rest-framework-filters) or any filter backend to do the actual filtering, Once you've configured it, you can continue to use all of the features found in filter backend of your choise as usual. The purpose of Django RESTQL on filtering is only to generate query parameters form query arguments. For example if you have a query like

```
query = (age: 18){
    name,
    age,
    location(country: Canada, city: Toronto){
        country,
        city
    }
}
```

Django RESTQL would generate three query parameters from this as shown below
```py
query_params = {"age": 18, "location__country": "Canada", "location__city": "Toronto"}
```
These will be used by the filter backend you have set to do the actual filtering.

The same applies to pagination, sorting etc, once you have configured your pagination class whether it's `PageNumberPagination`, `LimitOffsetPagination`, `CursorPagination` or a custom, you will be able do it with query arguments. For example if you're using `LimitOffsetPagination` and you have a query like 

```
query = (limit: 20, offset: 50){
    name,
    age,
    location{
        country,
        city
    }
}
```

Django RESTQL would generate two query parameters from this as shown below
```py
query_params = {"limit": 20, "offset": 50}
```
These will be used by pagination class you have set to do the actual pagination.

So to use query arguments as query parameters all you need to do is inherit `QueryArgumentsMixin` to your viewset to convert query arguments into query parameters, from there you can use whatever you want to accomplish whatever with those generated query parameters.


## Setting up eager loading
Often times, using `prefetch_related` or `select_related` on a view queryset can help speed up the serialization. For example, if you had a many-to-many relation like Books to a Course, it's usually more efficient to call `prefetch_related` on the books so that serializing a list of courses only triggers one additional query, instead of a number of queries equal to the number of courses.

`EagerLoadingMixin` gives access to `prefetch_related` and `select_related` properties, these two are dictionaries that match serializer field names to respective values that would be passed into `prefetch_related` or `select_related`. Take the following serializers as examples.

```py
class CourseSerializer(DynamicFieldsMixin, serializers.ModelSerializer):
    books = BookSerializer(many=True, read_only=True)

    class Meta:
        model = Course
        fields = ["name", "code", "books"]

class StudentSerializer(DynamicFieldsMixin, serializers.ModelSerializer):
    program = CourseSerializer(source="course", many=False, read_only=True)
    phone_numbers = PhoneSerializer(many=True, read_only=True)

    class Meta:
        model = Student
        fields = ["name", "age", "program", "phone_numbers"]
```

In a view, these can be used as described earlier in this documentation. However, if prefetching of `books` always happened, but we did not ask for `{program}` or `program{books}`, then we did an additional query for nothing. Conversely, not prefetching can lead to even more queries being triggered. When leveraging the `EagerLoadingMixin` on a view, the specific fields that warrant a `select_related` or `prefetch_related` can be described.


### Syntax for prefetch_related and select_related
The format of syntax for `select_related` and  `prefetch_related` is as follows

```py
select_related = {"serializer_field_name": ["field_to_select"]}
prefetch_related = {"serializer_field_name": ["field_to_prefetch"]}
```

If you are selecting or prefetching one field per serializer field name you can use
```py
select_related = {"serializer_field_name": "field_to_select"}
prefetch_related = {"serializer_field_name": "field_to_prefetch"}
```

**Syntax Interpretation**

* `serializer_field_name` stands for the name of the field to prefetch or select(as named on a serializer).
* `fields_to_select` stands for argument(s) to pass when calling `select_related` method.
* `fields_to_prefetch` stands for arguments(s) to pass when calling `prefetch_related` method. This can be a string or `Prefetch` object.
* If you want to select or prefetch nested field use dot(.) to separate parent and child fields on `serializer_field_name` eg `parent.child`.


### Example of EagerLoadingMixin usage

```py
from rest_framework import viewsets
from django_restql.mixins import EagerLoadingMixin
from myapp.serializers import StudentSerializer
from myapp.models import Student

class StudentViewSet(EagerLoadingMixin, viewsets.ModelViewSet):
	serializer_class = StudentSerializer
	queryset = Student.objects.all()

    # The Interpretation of this is 
    # Select `course` only if program field is included in a query
    select_related = {
		"program": "course"
	}

    # The Interpretation of this is 
    # Prefetch `course__books` only if program or program.books 
    # fields are included in a query
	prefetch_related = {
		"program.books": "course__books"
	}
```

<h3>Example Queries</h3>

- `{name}`:  &nbsp;&nbsp; Neither `select_related` or `prefetch_related` will be run since neither field is present on the serializer for this query.

- `{program}`: &nbsp;&nbsp; Both `select_related` and `prefetch_related` will be run, since `program` is present in its entirety (including the `books` field).

- `{program{name}}`: &nbsp;&nbsp; Only `select_related` will be run, since `books` are not present on the program fields.

- `{program{books}}`: &nbsp;&nbsp; Both will be run here as well, since this explicitly fetches books.

<h3>More example to get you comfortable with the syntax</h3>
Assuming this is the structure of the model and corresponding field types 

```py
user = {
    username,        # string
    birthdate,       # string
    location {       # foreign key related field
        country,     # string
        city         # string
    },
    contact {        # foreign key related field
        email,       # string
        phone {      # foreign key related field
            number,  # string
            type     # string
        }
    }
    articles {       # many related field
        title,       # string
        body,        # text
        reviews {    # many related field
            comment, # string
            rating   # number
        }
    }
}
```

Here is how `select_related` and `prefetch_related` could be written for this model
```py
select_related = {
    "location": "location",
    "contact": "contact",
    "contact.phone": "contact__phone"
}

prefetch_related = {
    "articles": Prefetch("articles", queryset=Article.objects.all()),
    "articles.reviews": "articles__reviews"
}
```

### Known Caveats
When prefetching with a `to_attr`, ensure that there are no collisions. Django does not allow multiple prefetches with the same `to_attr` on the same queryset.

When prefetching *and* calling `select_related` on a field, Django may error, since the ORM does allow prefetching a selectable field, but not both at the same time.
