With Django RESTQL you will be able to Send a query to your API and get exactly what you need, nothing more and nothing less. Control the data you get, not the server. Get predictable results, since you control what you get from the server. Get nested resources in a single request. Avoid Over-fetching and Under-fetching of data. Write(create & update) nested data of any level with flexibility. Isn't it cool?. Requirements \u00b6 Python >= 3.5 Django >= 1.11 Django REST Framework >= 3.5 Installing \u00b6 pip install django-restql Querying Data \u00b6 Using Django RESTQL to query data is very simple, you just have to inherit the DynamicFieldsMixin class when defining a serializer that's all. from rest_framework import serializers from django.contrib.auth.models import User from django_restql.mixins import DynamicFieldsMixin class UserSerializer(DynamicFieldsMixin, serializer.ModelSerializer): class Meta: model = User fields = ['id', 'username', 'email'] A regular request returns all fields as specified on a DRF serializer, in fact Django RESTQL doesn't handle this request at all. Below is an example of regular request, as you see all fields are returned as specified on UserSerializer . GET /users [ { \"id\": 1, \"username\": \"yezyilomo\", \"email\": \"yezileliilomo@hotmail.com\", }, ... ] Querying flat fields \u00b6 Django RESTQL handle all GET requests with a query parameter, this parameter is the one used to pass all fields to be included/excluded in a response. For example to select id and username fields from User model, send a request with a query parameter as shown below. GET /users/?query={id, username} [ { \"id\": 1, \"username\": \"yezyilomo\" }, ... ] Querying nested fields \u00b6 Django RESTQL support querying both flat and nested resources, so you can expand or query nested fields at any level as defined on a serializer. In an example below we have location and groups as nested fields on User model. from rest_framework import serializers from django.contrib.auth.models import User from django_restql.mixins import DynamicFieldsMixin from app.models import GroupSerializer, LocationSerializer class GroupSerializer(DynamicFieldsMixin, serializer.ModelSerializer): class Meta: model = Group fields = ['id', 'name'] class LocationSerializer(DynamicFieldsMixin, serializer.ModelSerializer): class Meta: model = Location fields = ['id', 'country', 'city', 'street'] class UserSerializer(DynamicFieldsMixin, serializer.ModelSerializer): groups = GroupSerializer(many=True, read_only=True) location = LocationSerializer(many=False, read_only=True) class Meta: model = User fields = ['id', 'username', 'email', 'location', 'groups'] If you want only country and city fields on a location field when retrieving users here is how you can do it GET /users/?query={id, username, location{country, city}} [ { \"id\": 1, \"username\": \"yezyilomo\", \"location\": { \"contry\": \"Tanzania\", \"city\": \"Dar es salaam\" } }, ... ] More examples to get you comfortable with the query syntax \u00b6 GET /users/?query={location, groups} [ { \"location\": { \"id\": 1, \"contry\": \"Tanzania\", \"city\": \"Dar es salaam\", \"street\": \"Oyster Bay\" } \"groups\": [ {\"id\": 2, \"name\": \"Auth_User\"}, {\"id\": 3, \"name\": \"Admin_User\"} ] }, ... ] GET /users/?query={id, username, groups{name}} [ { \"id\": 1, \"username\": \"yezyilomo\", \"groups\": [ {\"name\": \"Auth_User\"}, {\"name\": \"Admin_User\"} ] }, ... ] Exclude(-) operator \u00b6 When using Django RESTQL filtering as-is is great if there are no many fields on a serializer, but sometimes you might have a case where you would like everything except a handful of fields on a larger serializer. These fields might be nested and trying the whitelist approach is difficult or possibly too long for the url. Django RESTQL comes with the exclude(-) operator which can be used to exclude some fields in scenarios where you want to get all fields except few. Using exclude syntax is very simple,you just need to prepend the field to exclude with the exclude(-) operator when writing your query that's all. Take an example below from rest_framework import serializers from django_restql.mixins import DynamicFieldsMixin from app.models import Location, Property class LocationSerializer(DynamicFieldsMixin, serializer.ModelSerializer): class Meta: model = Location fields = [\"id\", \"city\", \"country\", \"state\", \"street\"] class PropertySerializer(DynamicFieldsMixin, serializer.ModelSerializer): location = LocationSerializer(many=False, read_only=True) class Meta: model = Property fields = [ 'id', 'price', 'location' ] Get all location fields except id and street GET /location/?query={-id, -street} [ { \"country\": \"China\", \"city\": \"Beijing\", \"state\": \"Chaoyang\" }, ... ] This is equivalent to query={country, city, state} You can use exclude operator on nested fields too, for example if you want to get price and location fields but under location you want all fields except id here is how you can do it. GET /property/?query={price, location{-id}} [ { \"price\": 5000 \"location\": { \"country\": \"China\", \"city\" \"Beijing\", \"state\": \"Chaoyang\", \"street\": \"Hanang\" } }, ... ] This is equivalent to query={price, location{country, city, state, street}} More examples to get you comfortable with the exclude(-) operator syntax \u00b6 Assuming this is the structure of the model we are querying data = { username, birthdate, location { country, city }, contact { phone, email } } Here is how we can structure our query to exclude some fields using exclude(-) operator {-username} \u2261 {birthdate, location{country, city}, contact{phone, email}} {-username, contact{phone}, location{country}} \u2261 {birthdate ,contact{phone}, location{country}} {-contact, location{country}} \u2261 {username, birthdate, location{country}} {-contact, -location} \u2261 {username, birthdate} {username, location{-country}} \u2261 {username, location{city}} {username, location{-city}, contact{-email}} \u2261 {username, location{country}, contact{phone}} Wildcard(*) operator \u00b6 In addition to exclude(-) operator, Django RESTQL comes with a wildcard(*) operator for including all fields. Just like exclude(-) operator using a wildcard(*) operator is very simple, for example if you want to get all fields from a model you just need to do query={*} . This operator can be used to simplify some filtering which might endup being very long if done with other approaches. For example if you have a model with this format user = { username, birthdate, contact { phone, email, twitter, github, linkedin, facebook } } Let's say you want to get all user fields but under contact field you want to get only phone , you could use the whitelisting approach as query={username, birthdate, contact{phone}} but if you have many fields on user model you might endup writing a very long query, so with * operator you can simply do query={*, contact{phone}} which means get me all fields on user model but under contact field I want only phone field, as you see the query is very short compared to the first one and it won't grow if more fields are added to the user model. More examples to get you comfortable with the wildcard(*) operator syntax \u00b6 {*, -username, contact{phone}} \u2261 {birthdate, contact{phone}} {username, contact{*, -facebook, -linkedin}} \u2261 {username, contact{phone, email, twitter, github}} {*, -username, contact{*, -facebook, -linkedin}} \u2261 {birthdate, contact{phone, email, twitter, github}} Below is a list of mistakes which leads to syntax error, these mistakes may happen accidentally as it's very easy/tempting to make them with the exclude(-) operator and wildcard(*) operator syntax. {username, -location{country}} # Should not expand excluded field {*username} # What are you even trying to accomplish {*location{country}} # This is def wrong {-username, birthdate} # Should not whitelist and blacklist fields # at the same field level Note: Any field level should either be whitelisting or blacklisting fields but not both. DynamicSerializerMethodField \u00b6 DynamicSerializerMethodField is a wraper of the SerializerMethodField , it adds a query argument from a parent serializer to a method bound to a SerializerMethodField , this query argument can be passed to a serializer used within a method to allow further querying. For example in the scenario below we are using DynamicSerializerMethodField because we want to be able to query tomes field. from django_restql.mixins import DynamicFieldsMixin from django_restql.fields import DynamicSerializerMethodField class CourseSerializer(DynamicFieldsMixin, serializers.ModelSerializer): # Use `DynamicSerializerMethodField` instead of `SerializerMethodField` # if you want to be able to query `tomes` tomes = DynamicSerializerMethodField() class Meta: model = Course fields = ['name', 'code', 'tomes'] def get_tomes(self, obj, query): # With `DynamicSerializerMethodField` you get this extra # `query` argument in addition to `obj` books = obj.books.all() # You can do what ever you want in here # `query` param and context are passed to BookSerializer to allow querying it serializer = BookSerializer( books, many=True, query=query, context=self.context ) return serializer.data GET /course/?query={name, tomes} [ { \"name\": \"Data Structures\", \"tomes\": [ {\"title\": \"Advanced Data Structures\", \"author\": \"S.Mobit\"}, {\"title\": \"Basic Data Structures\", \"author\": \"S.Mobit\"} ] } ] GET /course/?query={name, tomes{title}} [ { \"name\": \"Data Structures\", \"tomes\": [ {\"title\": \"Advanced Data Structures\"}, {\"title\": \"Basic Data Structures\"} ] } ] DynamicFieldsMixin kwargs \u00b6 DynamicFieldsMixin accepts extra kwargs in addition to those accepted by a serializer, these extra kwargs can be used to do more customizations on a serializer as explained below. fields kwarg \u00b6 With Django RESTQL you can specify fields to be included when instantiating a serializer, this provides a way to refilter fields on nested fields(i.e you can opt to remove some fields on a nested field). Below is an example which shows how you can specify fields to be included on nested resources. from rest_framework import serializers from django.contrib.auth.models import User from django_restql.mixins import DynamicFieldsMixin from app.models import Book, Course class BookSerializer(DynamicFieldsMixin, serializers.ModelSerializer): class Meta: model = Book fields = ['id', 'title', 'author'] class CourseSerializer(DynamicFieldsMixin, serializers.ModelSerializer): books = BookSerializer(many=True, read_only=True, fields=[\"title\"]) class Meta: model = Course fields = ['name', 'code', 'books'] GET /courses/ [ { \"name\": \"Computer Programming\", \"code\": \"CS50\", \"books\": [ {\"title\": \"Computer Programming Basics\"}, {\"title\": \"Data structures\"} ] }, ... ] As you see from the response above, the nested resource(book) has only one field(title) as specified on fields=[\"title\"] kwarg during instantiating BookSerializer, so if you send a request like GET /course?query={name, code, books{title, author}} you will get an error that author field is not found because it was not included on fields=[\"title\"] kwarg. exclude kwarg \u00b6 You can also specify fields to be excluded when instantiating a serializer by using exclude kwarg, below is an example which shows how to use exclude kwarg. from rest_framework import serializers from django_restql.mixins import DynamicFieldsMixin from app.models import Book, Course class BookSerializer(DynamicFieldsMixin, serializers.ModelSerializer): class Meta: model = Book fields = ['id', 'title', 'author'] class CourseSerializer(DynamicFieldsMixin, serializers.ModelSerializer): books = BookSerializer(many=True, read_only=True, exclude=[\"author\"]) class Meta: model = Course fields = ['name', 'code', 'books'] GET /courses/ [ { \"name\": \"Computer Programming\", \"code\": \"CS50\", \"books\": [ {\"id\": 1, \"title\": \"Computer Programming Basics\"}, {\"id\": 2, \"title\": \"Data structures\"} ] }, ... ] From the response above you can see that author field has been excluded fom book nested resource as specified on exclude=[\"author\"] kwarg during instantiating BookSerializer. Note: fields and exclude kwargs have no effect when you access the resources directly, so when you access books you will still get all fields i.e GET /books/ [ { \"id\": 1, \"title\": \"Computer Programming Basics\", \"author\": \"S.Mobit\" }, ... ] So you can see that all fields have appeared as specified on fields = ['id', 'title', 'author'] on BookSerializer class. return_pk kwarg \u00b6 With Django RESTQL you can specify whether to return nested resource pk or data. Below is an example which shows how we can use return_pk kwarg. from rest_framework import serializers from django_restql.mixins import DynamicFieldsMixin from app.models import Book, Course class BookSerializer(DynamicFieldsMixin, serializers.ModelSerializer): class Meta: model = Book fields = ['id', 'title', 'author'] class CourseSerializer(DynamicFieldsMixin, serializers.ModelSerializer): books = BookSerializer(many=True, read_only=True, return_pk=True) class Meta: model = Course fields = ['name', 'code', 'books'] GET /course/ [ { \"name\": \"Computer Programming\", \"code\": \"CS50\", \"books\": [1, 2] }, ... ] So you can see that on a nested field books pks have been returned instead of books data as specified on return_pk=True kwarg on BookSerializer . disable_dynamic_fields kwarg \u00b6 Sometimes there are cases where you want to disable fields filtering with on a specific nested field, Django RESTQL allows you to do so by using disable_dynamic_fields kwarg when instantiating a serializer. Below is an example which shows how to use disable_dynamic_fields kwarg. from rest_framework import serializers from django_restql.mixins import DynamicFieldsMixin from app.models import Book, Course class BookSerializer(DynamicFieldsMixin, serializers.ModelSerializer): class Meta: model = Book fields = ['id', 'title', 'author'] class CourseSerializer(DynamicFieldsMixin, serializers.ModelSerializer): # Disable fields filtering on this field books = BookSerializer(many=True, read_only=True, disable_dynamic_fields=True) class Meta: model = Course fields = ['name', 'code', 'books'] GET /course/?query={name, books{title}} [ { \"name\": \"Computer Programming\", \"books\": [ {\"id\": 1, \"title\": \"Computer Programming Basics\", \"author\": \"J.Vough\"}, {\"id\": 2, \"title\": \"Data structures\", \"author\": \"D.Denis\"} ] }, ... ] So you can see that even though the query asked for only title field under books , all fields have been returned, so this means fields filtering has applied on CourseSerializer but not on BookSerializer because we used disable_dynamic_fields=True on it. Query arguments \u00b6 Just like GraphQL, Django RESTQL allows you to pass arguments on nested fields. These arguments can be used to do filtering, sorting and other stuffs that you like them to do. Below is a syntax for passing arguments query = (age: 18){ name, age, location(country: Canada, city: Toronto){ country, city } } Here we have three arguments, age , country and city and their corresponding values. Filtering with query arguments \u00b6 As mentioned before you can use query arguments to do filtering, Django RESTQL itself doesn't do filtering but you can intergrate it with django-filter or djangorestframework-filters to do the actual filtering, in this case Django RESTQL will be providing query arguments as filter parameters to these libraries. To integrate with django-filter edit your settings.py file as shown below # settings.py REST_FRAMEWORK = { # This is needed to be able to get filter parameters from query arguments DEFAULT_FILTER_BACKEND = 'django_restql.filters.RESTQLFilterBackend' } RESTQL = { # This tells django-restql which filter backend to use(send generated filter parameters to) DEFAULT_BASE_FILTER_BACKEND = 'django_filters.rest_framework.DjangoFilterBackend' } And for djangorestframework-filters # settings.py REST_FRAMEWORK = { # This is needed to be able to get filter parameters from query arguments DEFAULT_FILTER_BACKEND = 'django_restql.filters.RESTQLFilterBackend' } RESTQL = { # This tells django-restql which filter backend to use(send generated filter parameters to) DEFAULT_BASE_FILTER_BACKEND = 'rest_framework_filters.backends.RestFrameworkFilterBackend' } Once configured, you can continue to use all of the features found in django-filter or djangorestframework-filters as usual. The purpose of Django RESTQL on filtering is only to generate filter parameters form query arguments, for example if you have a query like query = (age: 18){ name, age, location(country: Canada, city: Toronto){ country, city } } Django RESTQL would generate three filter parameters from this as shown below and send them to DEFAULT_BASE_FILTER_BACKEND set for it to do the filtering. filter_params = {\"age\": 18, \"location__country\": \"Canada\", \"location__city\": \"Toronto\"} If those two libraries doesn't satisfy your needs on filtering, you can write your own filter backend or extend one of those provided by these two libraries and set it on DEFAULT_BASE_FILTER_BACKEND . Setting up eager loading \u00b6 Often times, using prefetch_related or select_related on a view queryset can help speed up the serialization. For example, if you had a many-to-many relation like Books to a Course, it's usually more efficient to call prefetch_related on the books so that serializing a list of courses only triggers one additional query, instead of a number of queries equal to the number of courses. EagerLoadingMixin gives access to prefetch_related and select_related properties, these two are dictionaries that match serializer field names to respective values that would be passed into prefetch_related or select_related . Take the following serializers as examples. class CourseSerializer(DynamicFieldsMixin, serializers.ModelSerializer): books = BookSerializer(many=True, read_only=True) class Meta: model = Course fields = ['name', 'code', 'books'] class StudentSerializer(DynamicFieldsMixin, serializers.ModelSerializer): program = CourseSerializer(source=\"course\", many=False, read_only=True) phone_numbers = PhoneSerializer(many=True, read_only=True) class Meta: model = Student fields = ['name', 'age', 'program', 'phone_numbers'] In a view, these can be used as described earlier in this documentation. However, if prefetching of books always happened, but we did not ask for {program} or program{books} , then we did an additional query for nothing. Conversely, not prefetching can lead to even more queries being triggered. When leveraging the EagerLoadingMixin on a view, the specific fields that warrant a select_related or prefetch_related can be described. Syntax for prefetch_related and select_related \u00b6 The format of syntax for select_related and prefetch_related is as follows select_related = {\"serializer_field_name\": [\"field_to_select\"]} prefetch_related = {\"serializer_field_name\": [\"field_to_prefetch\"]} If you are selecting or prefetching one field per serializer field name you can use select_related = {\"serializer_field_name\": \"field_to_select\"} prefetch_related = {\"serializer_field_name\": \"field_to_prefetch\"} Syntax Interpretation serializer_field_name stands for the name of the field to prefetch or select(as named on a serializer). fields_to_select stands for argument(s) to pass when calling select_related method. fields_to_prefetch stands for arguments(s) to pass when calling prefetch_related method. This can be a string or Prefetch object. If you want to select or prefetch nested field use dot(.) to separate parent and child fields on serializer_field_name eg parent.child . Example of EagerLoadingMixin usage \u00b6 from rest_framework import viewsets from django_restql.mixins import EagerLoadingMixin from myapp.serializers import StudentSerializer from myapp.models import Student class StudentViewSet(EagerLoadingMixin, viewsets.ModelViewSet): serializer_class = StudentSerializer queryset = Student.objects.all() # The Interpretation of this is # Select `course` only if program field is included in a query select_related = { \"program\": \"course\" } # The Interpretation of this is # Prefetch `course__books` only if program or program.books # fields are included in a query prefetch_related = { \"program.books\": \"course__books\" } Example Queries \u00b6 {name} : Neither select_related or prefetch_related will be run since neither field is present on the serializer for this query. {program} : Both select_related and prefetch_related will be run, since program is present in it's entirety (including the books field). {program{name}} : Only select_related will be run, since books are not present on the program fields. {program{books}} : Both will be run here as well, since this explicitly fetches books. More example to get you comfortable with the syntax \u00b6 Assuming this is the structure of the model and corresponding field types user = { username, # string birthdate, # string location { # foreign key related field country, # string city # string }, contact { # foreign key related field email, # string phone { # foreign key related field number, # string type # string } } articles { # many related field title, # string body, # text reviewers { # many related field name, # string rating # number } } } Here is how select_related and prefetch_related could be written for this model select_related = { \"location\": \"location\", \"contact\": \"contact\", \"contact.phone\": \"contact__phone\" } prefetch_related = { \"articles\": Prefetch(\"articles\", queryset=Article.objects.all()), \"articles.reviews\": \"articles__reviewers\" } Known Caveats \u00b6 When prefetching with a to_attr , ensure that there are no collisions. Django does not allow multiple prefetches with the same to_attr on the same queryset. When prefetching and calling select_related on a field, Django may error, since the ORM does allow prefetching a selectable field, but not both at the same time. Settings \u00b6 Configuration for Django RESTQL is all namespaced inside a single Django setting named RESTQL , below is a list of what you can configure under RESTQL setting. QUERY_PARAM_NAME \u00b6 The default value for this is query . If you don't want to use the name query as your parameter, you can change it with QUERY_PARAM_NAME on settings file e.g RESTQL = { 'QUERY_PARAM_NAME' = \"your_favourite_name\" } Now you can use the name your_favourite_name as your query parameter. E.g GET /users/?your_favourite_name={id, username} DEFAULT_BASE_FILTER_BACKEND \u00b6 The default value for this is object . This is used if you want to use query arguments to do filtering, this is discussed in detail on Filtering with query arguments AUTO_APPLY_EAGER_LOADING \u00b6 The default value for this is True . When using the EagerLoadingMixin , this setting controls if the mappings for select_related and prefetch_related are applied automatically when calling get_queryset . To turn it off, set the AUTO_APPLY_EAGER_LOADING setting or auto_apply_eager_loading attribute on the view to False . # settings.py file # This will turn off auto apply eager loading globally RESTQL = { 'AUTO_APPLY_EAGER_LOADING' = False } If auto apply eager loading is turned off, the method apply_eager_loading can still be used on your queryset if you wish to select or prefetch related fields according to your conditions, For example you can check if there was a query parameter passed in by using has_restql_query_param , if true then apply eager loading otherwise return a normal queryset. from rest_framework import viewsets from django_restql.mixins import EagerLoadingMixin from myapp.serializers import StudentSerializer from myapp.models import Student class StudentViewSet(EagerLoadingMixin, viewsets.ModelViewSet): serializer_class = StudentSerializer queryset = Student.objects.all() # Turn off auto apply eager loading per view # This overrides the `AUTO_APPLY_EAGER_LOADING` setting on this view auto_apply_eager_loading = False select_related = { \"program\": \"course\" } prefetch_related = { \"program.books\": \"course__books\" } def get_queryset(self): queryset = super().get_queryset() if self.has_restql_query_param: queryset = self.apply_eager_loading(queryset) return queryset Mutating Data \u00b6 Django RESTQL got your back on creating and updating nested data too, it has two components for mutating nested data, NestedModelSerializer and NestedField . A serializer NestedModelSerializer has update and create logics for nested fields on the other hand NestedField is used to validate data before calling update or create method. Using NestedField and NestedModelSerializer \u00b6 Just like in querying data, mutating nested data with Django RESTQL is very simple, you just have to inherit NestedModelSerializer on a serializer with nested fields and use NestedField to define those nested fields. Below is an example which shows how to use NestedModelSerializer and NestedField . from rest_framework import serializers from django_restql.serializers import NestedModelSerializer from django_restql.fields import NestedField from app.models import Location, Amenity, Property class LocationSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer): class Meta: model = Location fields = [\"id\", \"city\", \"country\"] class AmenitySerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer): class Meta: model = Amenity fields = [\"id\", \"name\"] # Inherit NestedModelSerializer to support create and update # on nested fields class PropertySerializer(NestedModelSerializer): # Define location as nested field location = NestedField(LocationSerializer) # Define amenities as nested field amenities = NestedField(AmenitySerializer, many=True) class Meta: model = Property fields = [ 'id', 'price', 'location', 'amenities' ] POST /api/property/ Request Body { \"price\": 60000, \"location\": { \"city\": \"Newyork\", \"country\": \"USA\" }, \"amenities\": { \"add\": [3], \"create\": [ {\"name\": \"Watererr\"}, {\"name\": \"Electricity\"} ] } } What's done here is pretty clear, location will be created and associated with the property created, also create operation on amenities will create amenities with values specified in a list and associate with the property, add operation will add amenity with id 4 to a list of amenities of the property. Note: POST for many related field supports two operations which are create and add . Response { \"id\": 2, \"price\": 60000, \"location\": { \"id\": 3, \"city\": \"Newyork\", \"country\": \"USA\" }, \"amenities\": [ {\"id\": 1, \"name\": \"Watererr\"}, {\"id\": 2, \"name\": \"Electricity\"}, {\"id\": 3, \"name\": \"Swimming Pool\"} ] } PUT /api/property/2/ Request Body { \"price\": 50000, \"location\": { \"city\": \"Newyork\", \"country\": \"USA\" }, \"amenities\": { \"add\": [4], \"create\": [{\"name\": \"Fance\"}], \"remove\": [3], \"update\": {1: {\"name\": \"Water\"}} } } Note: Here add , create , remove and update are operations, so add operation add amenitiy with id 4 to a list of amenities of the property, create operation create amenities with values specified in a list, remove operation dessociate amenities with id 3 from a property, update operation edit amenity with id 1 according to values specified. Note: PUT/PATCH for many related field supports four operations which are create , add , remove and update . Response { \"id\": 2, \"price\": 50000, \"location\": { \"id\": 3, \"city\": \"Newyork\", \"country\": \"USA\" }, \"amenities\": [ {\"id\": 1, \"name\": \"Water\"}, {\"id\": 2, \"name\": \"Electricity\"}, {\"id\": 4, \"name\": \"Bathtub\"}, {\"id\": 5, \"name\": \"Fance\"} ] } Using NestedField with accept_pk kwarg. \u00b6 accept_pk=True is used if you want to update nested field by using pk/id of existing data(basically associate and dessociate existing nested resources with the parent resource without actually mutating the nested resource). This applies to ForeignKey relation only. from rest_framework import serializers from django_restql.fields import NestedField from django_restql.serializers import NestedModelSerializer from app.models import Location, Property class LocationSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer): class Meta: model = Location fields = [\"id\", \"city\", \"country\"] class PropertySerializer(NestedModelSerializer): # pk based nested field location = NestedField(LocationSerializer, accept_pk=True) class Meta: model = Property fields = [ 'id', 'price', 'location' ] POST /api/property/ Request Body { \"price\": 40000, \"location\": 2 } Note: Here location resource with id 2 is already existing, so what's done here is create new property resource and associate it with a location with id 2. Response { \"id\": 1, \"price\": 40000, \"location\": { \"id\": 2, \"city\": \"Tokyo\", \"country\": \"China\" } } Using NestedField with create_ops and update_ops kwargs. \u00b6 You can restrict some operations by using create_ops and update_ops keyword arguments as follows from rest_framework import serializers from django_restql.fields import NestedField from django_restql.serializers import NestedModelSerializer from app.models import Location, Amenity, Property class AmenitySerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer): class Meta: model = Amenity fields = [\"id\", \"name\"] class PropertySerializer(NestedModelSerializer): amenities = NestedField( AmenitySerializer, many=True, create_ops=[\"add\"], # Allow only add operation update_ops=[\"add\", \"remove\"] # Allow only add and remove operations ) class Meta: model = Property fields = [ 'id', 'price', 'amenities' ] POST /api/property/ Request Body { \"price\": 60000, \"amenities\": { \"add\": [1, 2] } } Note: According to create_ops=[\"add\"] , you can't use create operation in here!. Response { \"id\": 2, \"price\": 60000, \"amenities\": [ {\"id\": 1, \"name\": \"Watererr\"}, {\"id\": 2, \"name\": \"Electricity\"} ] } PUT /api/property/2/ Request Body { \"price\": 50000, \"amenities\": { \"add\": [3], \"remove\": [2] } } Note: According to update_ops=[\"add\", \"remove\"] , you can't use create or update operation in here!. Response { \"id\": 2, \"price\": 50000, \"amenities\": [ {\"id\": 1, \"name\": \"Water\"}, {\"id\": 3, \"name\": \"Bathtub\"} ] } Using DynamicFieldsMixin and NestedField together \u00b6 You can use DynamicFieldsMixin and NestedModelSerializer together if you want your serializer to be writable(on nested fields) and support querying data, this is very common. Below is an example which shows how you can use DynamicFieldsMixin and NestedField together. from rest_framework import serializers from django_restql.fields import NestedField from django_restql.mixins import DynamicFieldsMixin from django_restql.serializers import NestedModelSerializer from app.models import Location, Property class LocationSerializer(DynamicFieldsMixin, serializers.ModelSerializer): class Meta: model = Location fields = [\"id\", \"city\", \"country\"] # Inherit both DynamicFieldsMixin and NestedModelSerializer class PropertySerializer(DynamicFieldsMixin, NestedModelSerializer): location = NestedField(LocationSerializer) class Meta: model = Property fields = [ 'id', 'price', 'location' ] NestedField is nothing but a serializer wrapper, it returns an instance of a modified version of a serializer passed, so you can pass all the args and kwargs accepted by a serializer on it, it will simply pass them to a serializer passed when instantiating an instance. So you can pass anything accepted by a serializer to a NestedField wrapper, and if a serializer passed inherits DynamicFieldsMini just like LocationSerializer on above example then you can pass any arg or kwarg accepted by DynamicFieldsMixin when defining location as a nested field, i.e location = NestedField(LocationSerializer, fields=[...]) location = NestedField(LocationSerializer, exclude=[...]) location = NestedField(LocationSerializer, return_pk=True)","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"Django RESTQL is a python library which allows you to turn your API made with Django REST Framework(DRF) into a GraphQL like API.

For example if you have a model with this format user = { username, birthdate, contact { phone, email, twitter, github, linkedin, facebook } } Let's say you want to get all user fields but under contact field you want to get only phone , you could use the whitelisting approach as query={username, birthdate, contact{phone}} but if you have many fields on user model you might endup writing a very long query, so with * operator you can simply do query={*, contact{phone}} which means get me all fields on user model but under contact field I want only phone field, as you see the query is very short compared to the first one and it won't grow if more fields are added to the user model.","title":"Wildcard(*) operator"},{"location":"#more-examples-to-get-you-comfortable-with-the-wildcard42-operator-syntax","text":"{*, -username, contact{phone}} \u2261 {birthdate, contact{phone}} {username, contact{*, -facebook, -linkedin}} \u2261 {username, contact{phone, email, twitter, github}} {*, -username, contact{*, -facebook, -linkedin}} \u2261 {birthdate, contact{phone, email, twitter, github}} Below is a list of mistakes which leads to syntax error, these mistakes may happen accidentally as it's very easy/tempting to make them with the exclude(-) operator and wildcard(*) operator syntax. {username, -location{country}} # Should not expand excluded field {*username} # What are you even trying to accomplish {*location{country}} # This is def wrong {-username, birthdate} # Should not whitelist and blacklist fields # at the same field level Note: Any field level should either be whitelisting or blacklisting fields but not both.","title":"More examples to get you comfortable with the wildcard(*) operator syntax"},{"location":"#dynamicserializermethodfield","text":"DynamicSerializerMethodField is a wraper of the SerializerMethodField , it adds a query argument from a parent serializer to a method bound to a SerializerMethodField , this query argument can be passed to a serializer used within a method to allow further querying.

EagerLoadingMixin gives access to prefetch_related and select_related properties, these two are dictionaries that match serializer field names to respective values that would be passed into prefetch_related or select_related .

However, if prefetching of books always happened, but we did not ask for {program} or program{books} , then we did an additional query for nothing.
